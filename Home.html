		<h3>Why we choose to help ...</h3>
		<br>
		<p>The reason I am choosing to do this as I once was building a pc too and I was given a whole lot of false information from different
			websites that I was about to make the choice to waste a whole lot of money on a prebuild pc that was not worth it. Where it was
			my friends that informed me that what I am doing now is cheaper, better quality and not getting ripped off by false or misleading
			information. There is a whole lot of research that is needed when trying to build a pc. So, I want my website to give the right
			information and to be that friend that helps you when you are going to invest a whole lot of money into technology that helps
			guide you to make the choice that you want to make that is not dictated by other websites false or misleading information.
